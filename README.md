# playground
This repository is a playground where I try out different technologies which I'm trying to understand in a little more detail.
It's a gradle project but the individual modules could be very different.

## Kafka Experiments
This module runs programs where I try out different kafka and kstream applications. You can find out more [here](kafka-experiments/README.md)
